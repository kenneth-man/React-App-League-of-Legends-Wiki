# React app 'League of Legends Wiki'

In this project I used useState, useContext and useEffect react hooks, to manage, share and render states between functional components.

I also implement routing using react-router-dom, with switch, route and navlink components to specify an exact path when the navigation buttons are pressed, (simulating routing in a single page application).

The API i used to gather the data and images are from the Riot game API for league of legends: https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol
